## Data and Code Availability

All data underlying the results reported in this study are publicly available.

An anonymized analytical dataset sufficient to reproduce all figures, tables, and modeling workflows has been deposited in a permanent public repository:

To protect sensitive infrastructure information and comply with contractual constraints, precise geographic coordinates were anonymized in the publicly released dataset and country identifiers were label-encoded. Consequently, numerical results that depend on fine-grained spatial variation may differ slightly from those reported in the manuscript, while the analytical workflows, model structure, and substantive conclusions remain unchanged.

Raw contractual data underlying the analytical dataset are subject to third-party restrictions; however, all data required to reproduce the analyses presented in this study are included in the archived dataset.
