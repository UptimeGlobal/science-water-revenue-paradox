This directory contains serialized model artifacts generated during model development.
Models are not required to reproduce the analyses reported in the manuscript and are provided for completeness only.

Geographic coordinates were anonymized in the publicly released dataset; consequently, numerical results that depend on fine-grained spatial variation may differ slightly from those reported in the manuscript, while all analytical workflows and conclusions remain unchanged
